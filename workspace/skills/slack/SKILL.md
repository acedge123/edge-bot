# Slack Actions

**Do not use this skill to deliver your reply when the conversation is from Slack (Echelon Slack channel).** For sessions with key `agent:main:slack:*`, the worker delivers your response to Slack; do not call send/message.send — it will fail or double-send. Use this skill for reactions, pins, read, member info, etc., but not for sending the main reply in Slack-origin threads.

**"Say hi to @X" / "message @X"**: When the user asks you to greet or message someone (e.g. "say hi to @jamie"), do **not** use sendMessage or any send action — the Slack adapter often rejects user targets (e.g. "Unknown target … for slack"). Instead, reply in-thread with your message including the @mention (e.g. "Hi @jamie!"). The worker will post that reply in the same channel/thread. That keeps the reply in channel and avoids the OpenClaw Slack target-resolution path.

## Overview

Use `slack` to react, manage pins, send/edit/delete messages, and fetch member info. The tool uses the bot token configured for Clawdbot.

## Inputs to collect

- `channelId` and `messageId` (Slack message timestamp, e.g. `1712023032.1234`).
- For reactions, an `emoji` (Unicode or `:name:`).
- For message sends, a `to` target (`channel:<id>` or `user:<id>`) and `content`.

Message context lines include `slack message id` and `channel` fields you can reuse directly.
